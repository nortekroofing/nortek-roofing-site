How to use:

1) Place services.html in the ROOT of your repo (same folder as index.html).
2) Add two images (also in ROOT):
   - services-commercial.jpg
   - services-residential.jpg
   Recommended: ~2000x1400 jpgs, 300â€“600 KB each.
3) Commit & push.

Troubleshooting:
- If images don't show, first commit without images using services-test.html to verify layout and glass effect.
- Ensure your style.css link path is correct for your repo (flat structure).
